# Stopwatch app

## Built using

Tools and software I used to build this project.

- HTML
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- JavaScript
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Used [Transfonter Website](https://transfonter.org) to self-host the fonts

## Process

I followed the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/d8-LGhKtzRw?si=QJLTHeCyfFbyFdB9) made by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez/) for building this project. It was a fun process and it took me about 4 hours(I was coding pretty slowly). The styling part is what took the most time. I also added an additional theme toggle and keyboard functionality.

## What I learned

- Learned DOM manipulation
- The `Date()` object
- the `keydown` event

## What's next?

I'll try making a **Todo list app** after this. It is one of the most important projects for any beginner in JS.

Thank you for coming by!
